Scott.
I've been watching you for a while now.
You're different.
Now don't let anyone tell you
that you have nothing to offer.
Second chances don't come around all that often.
I suggest you take a really close look at it.
This is your chance
to earn that look in your daughter's eyes,
to become the hero
that she already thinks you are.
It's not about saving our world,
it's about saving theirs.
Scott,
I need you
to be the Ant-Man.
Huh...
One question.
Is it too late to change the name?
