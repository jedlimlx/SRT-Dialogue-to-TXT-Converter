00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:10,321
Scott.

3
00:00:12,825 --> 00:00:15,275
I've been watching you
for a while now.

4
00:00:18,611 --> 00:00:19,961
You're different.

5
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,840
Now don't let anyone tell you 

6
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:27,459
that you have nothing to offer.

7
00:00:29,476 --> 00:00:32,571
Second chances
don't come around all that often.

8
00:00:33,314 --> 00:00:36,369
I suggest
you take a really close look at it.

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,832
This is your chance

10
00:00:45,856 --> 00:00:48,030
to earn that look
in your daughter's eyes,

11
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,650
to become the hero 

12
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:56,031
that she already thinks you are.

13
00:00:59,585 --> 00:01:01,685
It's not about saving our world,

14
00:01:03,818 --> 00:01:05,982
it's about saving theirs.

15
00:01:07,216 --> 00:01:08,217
Scott,

16
00:01:09,022 --> 00:01:10,271
I need you

17
00:01:11,701 --> 00:01:13,073
to be the Ant-Man.

18
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:16,771
Huh...

19
00:01:38,946 --> 00:01:40,600
One question.

20
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,228
Is it too late to change the name?
